The EEID 2024 workshop session *Estimating environmental response functions using Bayesian inference* will be developed on three sesions from 22nd June to 24th June of 2024. The sessions include both theoretical input and practical sessions. Practical sessions will take a relevant part of the time on which you will be developing exercises and activities. In addition, it is expected for each participant to develop a small project which will present at the end of the workshop. It is worth to keep in mind that working outside the synchronous sessions is suggested to achieve the objectives of the workshop given its schedule. 

You can access to activities, lectures, and readings in [materials](materials.html).
